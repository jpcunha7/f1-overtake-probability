# F1 Overtake Probability Model: "Can We Pass?"

**Machine learning system for predicting overtaking opportunities in Formula 1 races**

**Author:** João Pedro Cunha
**License:** MIT

---

## Overview

This project uses supervised machine learning to predict the probability of an overtake occurring in F1 races based on:
- **Gap to car ahead** (time difference)
- **Relative pace** (recent lap time comparison)
- **Tire age and compound** differences
- **Race phase** (early, middle, late)
- **Track context** (circuit characteristics)

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 **Supervised ML Pipeline**: Logistic Regression + XGBoost models
- 📊 **Calibrated Probabilities**: Isotonic/Platt calibration for reliable predictions
- 🔍 **Explainability**: Feature importance analysis
- 📈 **Interactive App**: Streamlit dashboard for scenario exploration
- ✅ **Robust Evaluation**: ROC AUC, PR AUC, Brier score, calibration curves

**100% Free**: Uses only open-source tools and FastF1 data.

## Methodology

### 1. Overtake Labeling Strategy

**Definition:**
An overtake opportunity exists when:
1. Driver `i` is directly behind driver `j` on lap `L`
2. We check if driver `i` is ahead of driver `j` within the next `K` laps (default K=1)

**Label:**
- `y = 1` if overtake occurs
- `y = 0` otherwise

**Pit Confounding Mitigation:**

Pit stops create artificial position changes. We filter these using:

✅ **Exclude laps where either driver pits** in current lap or lookahead window
✅ **Exclude laps with compound changes** (indicates pit stop)
✅ **Exclude outlier lap times** (formation laps, safety cars)
✅ **Minimum stint length requirement** (ensures clean data)

### 2. Feature Engineering

**Gap Features:**
- Time gap to car ahead
- Gap categorical bins (very_close, close, medium, far)

**Pace Features:**
- Rolling average lap times (3-lap window)
- Relative pace (difference in recent lap times)
- Pace ratio

**Tire Features:**
- Tire age difference (fresher tires = advantage)
- Compound difference (SOFT > MEDIUM > HARD)
- Same compound flag

**Race Phase Features:**
- Lap number / race progress
- Race phase (early/middle/late)

**Track Features:**
- Circuit identifier (one-hot encoded)

### 3. Model Training

**Baseline: Logistic Regression**
- Simple, interpretable
- Class weights for imbalance handling

**Advanced: XGBoost**
- Gradient boosting classifier
- Handles non-linear relationships
- Feature interactions
- Scale_pos_weight for imbalance

**Train/Test Split:**
- Split by **race weekend** (not random) to avoid leakage
- Test on completely unseen races
- Typical split: 70% train, 30% test

### 4. Probability Calibration

**Why Calibration Matters:**

Raw model probabilities may not reflect true frequencies. For example:
- Model predicts 70% → actual overtake rate might be 50%

**Calibration Methods:**
- **Isotonic Regression**: Non-parametric, flexible (default)
- **Platt Scaling**: Parametric, sigmoid-based

**After calibration:** Predicted 70% → ~70% of cases result in overtakes

### 5. Evaluation Metrics

**Classification Metrics:**
- **ROC AUC**: Overall discrimination ability
- **PR AUC**: Precision-recall trade-off (better for imbalanced data)
- **Brier Score**: Measures probability calibration quality (lower is better)

**Calibration:**
- **Calibration Curve**: Predicted vs actual frequencies
- **Histogram**: Distribution of predicted probabilities

**Feature Importance:**
- **Permutation Importance**: Feature impact on model performance
- **SHAP** (optional): Individual prediction explanations

## Modeling Assumptions & Limitations

### What We Model ✅

✅ Tire degradation differences
✅ Gap and relative pace
✅ Pit stop filtering (heuristic-based)
✅ Probability calibration
✅ Race phase effects

### What We DON'T Model ❌

❌ **DRS (Drag Reduction System)**: Major overtaking aid not explicitly modeled
❌ **Track-specific characteristics**: Overtaking difficulty varies by circuit
❌ **Traffic and backmarkers**: Multi-car interactions ignored
❌ **Weather conditions**: Rain/wet races not handled
❌ **Safety cars and VSC**: Some SC periods may leak through filtering
❌ **Driver skill differences**: Assumes all drivers equal
❌ **Incident-based position changes**: Crashes, mechanical failures
❌ **Perfect pit detection**: Label noise exists despite filtering

### Interpretation Guidelines

✅ **Do:** Use for comparative analysis ("How do gap and tire age affect overtake probability?")
✅ **Do:** Explore scenario sensitivity (what-if analysis)
✅ **Do:** Understand model limitations and uncertainty

❌ **Don't:** Treat predictions as absolute truth
❌ **Don't:** Ignore label noise and confounding factors
❌ **Don't:** Use for betting or real-time race strategy (insufficient real-time data)

**Transparency:** This is a **proxy model** with **label noise**. Position changes ≠ on-track overtakes.

## Data Source

**FastF1** (https://docs.fastf1.dev/)
- Free, open-source Python package
- F1 timing, telemetry, and race data
- Supports 2018-2025 seasons
- Data cached locally to avoid re-downloads

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No overtake opportunities found"
- Try different races (some have more overtaking)
- Check `max_gap` parameter (increase if too restrictive)
- Verify race data loaded successfully

### "Model performance is poor"
- This is expected! Overtakes are inherently unpredictable
- Typical ROC AUC: 0.60-0.75 (better than random but not perfect)
- High class imbalance (most opportunities don't result in overtakes)

### "Calibration curve shows poor calibration"
- Try different calibration method (isotonic vs sigmoid)
- Increase calibration dataset size
- Check for distribution shift between train/test races
